Hello all,
Welcome to my blog, still learning to build it tho :). so i'm a cyber security student, and i reallyneed to say the struggle is real, feeling like to give up already
It seems like i don't know what i'm doing. Been doing some SQLi challenges lately,and i realised that i've still got alot to learn. I aso have school to work hard in cause i made a promise tomy mum.
it's a very big breakdown when i realise that alot of people are relying on me and if my future doesn't turn out wel, its going to affect those i love.
Well enough for now,  later peaches.
